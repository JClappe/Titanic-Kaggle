# Titanic-Kaggle
Top 5% on Kaggle. Who will survive?


Hi and welcome to this Kaggle project!
Today we will learn from data. Let's take a dive into the Titanic disaster.
After a deep understanding of the data and some feature engineering, machine learning classifiers will be applied to predict titanic survivals.

There are three parts in this kernel:
1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
2 - Preprocessing
3 - Machine Learning


I hope you will find this work interresting, and maybe it could give you some fresh ideas about this subject.
